## How my payment processing works?

When you want to pay for your subscription, Coinbase will display instructions on how to send funds directly to us, and monitor the blockchain for your transaction.

After a valid payment is detected, we will be notified and update your subscription statys on our end.

All payments facilitated by Coinbase Commerce are fully decentralized and peer-to-peer. This means that the cryptocurrency goes directly from your wallet to our wallet.

## Can I use your service for free?

You have access to **Cryptuoso Trading Signals** provided by **Cryptuoso Trading Bot** in our [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/cryptuoso).

A signal for opening a deal tells you the deal type (short/long) and asset price to open a position. A close signal tells you what to do with the asset, depending on the type of position (sell/buy), and price to close trade.

There are more than 135 signals available for you to subscribe to. Yes, every signal you see is used by our robots that trade automatically (available on paid plan).
