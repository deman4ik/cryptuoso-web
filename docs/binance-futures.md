    **IMPORTANT!** Use the keys you create only in Cryptuoso account to prevent ban from Binance. It is essential that you store your API keys in a secure location and treat it like a password. Anyone with access to your API keys can take control of your account.

    **IMPORTANT!** Don't give us withdrawal permissions!

## Using an API Key

API keys consist of a public/private key(secret) pair, both of which must be provided to our software.
