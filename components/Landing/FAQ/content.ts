        title: "What is Cryptuoso?",
        text: `Cryptuoso is a cloud service that helps traders and investors automate cryptocurrency trading by using trading robots. All of our 135+ trading robots use pre-configured strategies and do not require any additional settings.`
    },
    {
        title: "Do you have free plan or trial version?",
        text: `Yes, we have both :)
        
        After registering you will get all free plan features. 
        
        If you want to try robots before switching to paid plans - activate free trial.`
    },
    {
        title: "How your free trial works?",
        text: `Usually trial periods are limited in time. But trading is like a rollercoaster - today you get a profit, tomorrow you don't.  You can evaluate the result  only at a distance.  

        Our robots use a variety of strategies and perform trades at different intervals, so it's hard to predict how many trades will occur during the trial period. 
        
        That's why we will let you use our robots for free until they earn you at least $15. After that the robots will continue to trade for an additional 5 days. If after the trial you decide not to switch to a paid plan, robots will close all positions and you will automatically switch to free plan.`
    },
    {
        title: "How your free plan works?",
        text: `On free plan you have access to trading signals. A signal for opening a deal tells you the deal type (short/long) and asset price to open a position. A close signal tells you what to do with the asset, depending on the type of position (sell/buy), and  price to close trade. 

        There are more than 135 signals available for you to subscribe to. Yes, every signal you see is used by our robots that trade automatically (available on paid plan).`

    {
        title: "Do I have to transfer my assets to your platform?",
        text: `No, you do not need to transfer your funds to our service. Your assets are stored on the exchange of your choice and we only manage them by accessing them via API-keys. 

        API keys have different settings and we only need permission to execute a deals. So please do not flag a permission to TRANSFER funds with an API key to avoid any possible issues.`

        title: "I trade manually. Why should I use your robots?",
        text: `There are many reasons, let's discuss the top 3. 

        1 - Time 
        
        Cryptocurrency exchanges run 24/7 and it is physically impossible for a person to trade on them without any interruptions or breaks.Robots can easily solve this problem. 
        
        2 - Emotions 
        
        Emotions make it easy to make a mistake and execute a high-risk trade.  Robots have no emotions and their actions are based only on accurate calculations.
        
        3 - Performance 
        
        A robot takes decisions many times faster and more accurately than a human. 
        `
    },
    {
        title: "Why is Cryptuoso better than other similar platforms?",
        text: `Look at the 3 main advantages of Cryptuoso: 

        1 - Our robots are all based on preconfigured and well tested strategies. So you don't need to invent a strategy every time, backtest it hundreds of times and only then start trading.  Needless to say, that it is impossible to create a truly advanced trading algorithm in any service, as we do through coding.
        
        2 - With Cryptuoso you have access to over 135+ trading robots: they use various strategies, exchanges, currency pairs and timeframes. It would be hard to find such a wide selection anywhere else.
        
        3 - Cryptuoso users have no restrictions on:
        
        - Trades amount
        - Opened positions amount
        - Trading volumes
        
        Also, we do not charge any fees on your turnovers.`
    },
    {
        title: "Why do you share your winning strategies with other people?",
        text: `We created these robots for ourselves, and over time we realized that they have high business potential. 

        We continue to invest through our service - each co-founder uses more than 20 robots in his personal portfolio. Earnings from Cryptuoso are an additional source of income. Just risk diversification :)`
    },
    {
        title: "Why were you in the beta version for so long?",
        text: `It is important for us to achieve a high quality of product to not disappoint our users. That's why we polished Cryptuoso before we revealed it to a wide audience :)`
    },
    {
        title: "How much capital do I need?",
        text: `Each robot has a minimum start volume of about 20$.

        But please keep in mind that we recommend to distribute your capital among several robots so the real answer is you need more than 100$ on your cryptocurrency exchange account.`
    },
    {
        title: "Do you guarantee that I will make profit with your signals/robots?",
        text: `We cannot guarantee any profits as that would be a scam. Based on historical trading data of our strategies we can declare that our robots are effective for medium and long term investments.

        We have a completely transparent trading history - most of our robots have been trading since 2017.  We do not hide bad trades or even unprofitable robots - everything stays in the history.  
        
        If you will run several robots and distribute your assets among them, you will diversify the risks and increase the chances of getting the desired profit.`
